# Reseqr

A software tool will be developed to solve the procedural problem of renaming image files in batches processed by the University Libraries' Imaging Services to correct batch orderings according to a "resequence" order as specified in METS files associated with each batch.

## Project Setup

   - operate on a single batch per program execution
   - validate image file batch for expected naming conventions
   - validate batch METS files for expected conventions
   - validate correlation between image files and METS descriptors
   - report validation results to screen and file
   - determine and report intended file renaming
   - option to only validate and report
   - rename image files in two-phase process to avoid collision
   - mark batches to avoid double execution
   - report on renaming results
   - editable configuration file for each project's constant data
   - allow for differing concurrent projects
